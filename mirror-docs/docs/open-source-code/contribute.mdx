The Mirror is an open-source all-in-one game development platform, providing everything you need out-of-the-box to make a game/3D experiences, even if you've never written code in your life. The impetus behind labeling it an "open-source Roblox & UEFN alternatve" is because these are the two closest examples. Frankly, we're surprised there aren't more examples, especially with good graphics instead defaulting to cartoony styles.

We hope to change that! :)
