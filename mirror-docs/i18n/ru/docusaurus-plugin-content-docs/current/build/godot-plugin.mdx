# Godot Plugin (Coming Soon)

We understand that many developers prefer using the Godot engine for their game development needs. To accommodate this, we are actively working on adding a dedicated plugin to work Godot side-by-side with The Mirror in real-time. This will allow you to seamlessly integrate your Godot assets and projects into our game environment. Stay tuned for updates on how to import and use Godot assets in our API.

We are continuously expanding and improving our API to provide you with a comprehensive set of features and tools for game development. Your feedback is invaluable to us, so if you have any specific requests or suggestions regarding heightmaps, audio, particles, Godot import, or any other features, please don't hesitate to submit them on our [Feature Board.](https://in.themirror.space/feedback).
