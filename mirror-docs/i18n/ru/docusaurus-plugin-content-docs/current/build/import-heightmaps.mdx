# Heightmaps

- **Format**: We recommend EXR for highest quality.

- **File Size**: The maximum allowed file size for heightmaps is 15MB per file. This limitation is due to automatic compression isn't available at the moment. This limitation will increase in the future.

- **Texture Size**: Maximum size of 4K (4096x4096).

:::note
Similar to other texture files, we recommend adhering to the power of two rule when creating heightmaps. You can learn more [here](https://www.katsbits.com/tutorials/textures/make-better-textures-correct-size-and-power-of-two.php#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20power%20of,%2Ddown%20by%20%222%22.)
