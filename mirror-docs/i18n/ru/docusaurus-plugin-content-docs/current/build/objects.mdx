# Objects

# Create an Object

An object is simply an Asset that's in a Space. You can place as many Objects as you wish in-world, and they can all reference the same Asset.

## In-World

Assets can be uploaded by clicking "Click Here to Upload Asset" from the Asset Drawer.

Any Object created in-world will automatically show up on https://in.themirror.space.
