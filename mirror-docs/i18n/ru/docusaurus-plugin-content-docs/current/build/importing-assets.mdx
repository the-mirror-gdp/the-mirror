# How to Import

The Mirror allows you to import custom assets to create your games, such as 3D models, audio files, textures, height maps, and more.

It's important to understand the requirements to ensure a smooth importing experience. The Mirror is built on top of Godot, which means it inherits many of the requirements that Godot would expect when importing the asset.

NOTE: We strongly suggest importing .GLB files as they include all materials and other dependencies in a single file, similar to a .ZIP file.



## How To Import an Asset

- Enter Build Mode: In a Space, press `B` on your keyboard to open _Build Mode_.
