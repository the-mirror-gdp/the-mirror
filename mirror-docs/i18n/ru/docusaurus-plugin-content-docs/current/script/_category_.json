Coding can be daunting, which is why The Mirror provides no-code visual scripting out-of-the-box to make it easy for people of any skill level to build in The Mirror. Visual scripting is still programming, but high-level, and without needing to write code as text. Full support for GDScript is also available if you prefer writing text-based code."
